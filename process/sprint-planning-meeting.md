###Resolving Blocks

###High-level focus
**Outcome: Holodex data are relevant to users**
1. Outcome: Users can easily update their own data
1. Outcome: User's data updates reactively from other sources

**Notes:**

Tension: When we pull in data from other source, Holodex becomes a visualisation service but not a source of truth

Holodex does not impose a global "source of truth". An agents view of truth is subjective.

**Outcome: People understand Holodex is a legit business within Enspiral.** 

1. Outcome: People understand how Holodex aspires to provide a People and Groups API to:
 (a) solve the admin burden of maintaining group lists across platforms
 (b) solve the fatigue associated wth keeping user data consistent across platforms
 (c) reduce the development costs of creating software for groups
 (d) eliminates the cost of onboarding a network to the new platform
 
2. Users can discover People, groups and connections they were'nt aware of.
