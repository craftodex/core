###Resolving Blocks

###High-level focus
**Outcome: Holodex data is relevant to users**
1. Outcome: Users can easily update their own data
1. Outcome: User's data updates reactively from other sources

**Notes:**
Tension: When we pull in data from other source, Holodex becomes a visualisation service but not a source of truth

Holodex does not impose a global "source of truth". An agents view of truth is subjective.

**Outcome: People understand Holodex is a legit business.**
