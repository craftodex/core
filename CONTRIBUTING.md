# Contributing To Holodex

Our project is like local land stewarded by the [tangata whenua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangata_whenua).

We welcome all contributions, such as but not limited to:

- designs
- artwork
- code
- homepage
- documentation
- tests

If you contribute enough, you'll be invited to join the project stewards and given write-access to the project to contribute more as you see fit!

## Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:

1. **No `--force` pushes** or modifying the Git history in any way.
1. **Non-master branches** ought to be used for ongoing work.
1. **External interface changes and significant modifications** ought to be subject to an **internal pull-request** to solicit feedback from other contributors.
1. Internal pull-requests to solicit feedback are *encouraged* for any other non-trivial contribution but left to the discretion of the contributor.
1. Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing code-style.

## Releases

Declaring formal releases remains the prerogative of the project stewards.

## Changes to this arrangement

This is an experiment and feedback is welcome! This document may also be
subject to pull-requests or changes by contributors where you believe
you have something valuable to add or change.
