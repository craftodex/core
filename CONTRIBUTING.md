# Holodex is a JOIN Open Source Project

## What?

This project has stewards and protectors who put aside self-interest to act as Kaitiaki for the whole.

We welcome all contributions, such as but not limited to:

- designs
- artwork
- code
- homepage
- documentation
- tests

If you want to contribute, you're invited to join the project Contributors before we will accept your contribution.

If you contribute enough, you'll be invited to join the project Workers and be asked to contribute more as you see fit!

## Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:

1. **No `force` pushes** or modifying the project history in any way.
1. **Non-master branches** ought to be used for ongoing work.
1. **External interface changes and significant modifications** ought to be subject to an **internal pull-request** to solicit feedback from other contributors.
1. Internal pull-requests to solicit feedback are *encouraged* for any other non-trivial contribution but left to the discretion of the contributor.
1. Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing code-style.

## Releases

Declaring formal releases is the prerogative of the project Workers.
