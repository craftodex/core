##Holodex
In March and April Services funded Mikey and I ~2k total to create a read-only app for managing and visualising group data. You can read more about the problems we are trying to solve [here](https://github.com/open-app/holodex/blob/master/comms/value-propositions.md)


##Where we're at

We have a [demo of Holodex](http://holodex.enspiral.info/) for Enspiral Services' data!

The demo has 2 features. Navigate between groups and people, and filter the view by toggling role and link tags. The data are not as accurate as we'd like and there several bugs. We'll improve and expand it over this month to include all of Enspiral.

Mikey will be working on Holodex full time until immigration requires him to get a job (October). I will work on Holodex part-time through June. In July we may seek paying clients or funding to enable me to increase my commitment.

##We're we going

###In the short term:

Our current focus is to set up a Holodex landing page and do user problem discovery interviews and workshops.


###Design and Development:
Without prefiguring the user workshops too much, candidate features for short-term development are:

1. View more information about a person or group (email, social media accounts, location etc)
1. Make Holodex pages more sharable - share a link to a filtered view of Holodex.
1. Create other instances of Holodex for interested alpha testers.
1. View as a list - the current app is obviously a  'Network view' - we think this is a more useful visualisation for some relationships and for discovering connections. A more traditional 'List View' may also be useful.

###Medium term:
1. Make it possible to add data to Holodex (a write API).

###Possible directions
1. Spreadsheet integration - keep your group data in spreadsheet and visualise it with Holodex.
1. Slack integration - What does the comms backbone of your organisation look like? Your 'org chart' never goes out of date.
1. Wordpress plugin - Use your holodex interface as your 'About our team' page.

###What we need

Mostly we need feedback from the network to help guide our development. We're also interested in business development and opportunities.
