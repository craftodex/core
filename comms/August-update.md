## Holodex August 2015 Update




### Product Update

 * CSV

 * You can share a url to a particular view of Holodex. For example [stewardship](http://holodex.enspiral.com/groups/loomio?q%5B0%5D%5Blink%5D=%2FlinkTypes%2Fhas-member&q%5B0%5D%5Bsrc%5D=%2Fgroups%2Floomio&q%5B1%5D%5Blink%5D=%2FlinkTypes%2Fis-subgroup-of&q%5B1%5D%5Bsrc%5D=%2Fgroups%2Floomio&q%5B2%5D%5Blink%5D=%2FlinkTypes%2Fstewards&q%5B2%5D%5Bctx%5D=%2Fgroups%2Floomio&q%5B2%5D%5BshowLink%5D=true) in Loomio.

* You can 'zoom and pan' using the mousewheel and 'grabbing' the chart. Behold! [Enormous Mikey](http://holodex.enspiral.com/people/mikey?v%5B0%5D=-3308&v%5B1%5D=-1851&v%5B2%5D=5.880006065834972)!

* Context relationships (like stewardship) now have a 'toggle widget' for toggling the links. We're still [exploring the designs](https://beta.atomic.io/d/2oKCUOzyYEow) for this.

* By popular demand, you can now view more details about an agent by hovering over it with the cursor. A tooltip will pop up with a larger avatar image and name. In the future this may have more details (location, interests etc).

### Strategy

In no particular order:

1. Develop an MVP.
2. Get opensource contributors by making the codebase and stack legit and leveraging Mikey's role as Nodeschool Wellington facilitator
3. Improve what we  already have. Improvements within the current design: mobile responsive, improve search, more details about people and groups, tags etc.
