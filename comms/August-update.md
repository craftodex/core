## Holodex August 2015 Update

### Product Update

We've added some new features and worked on designs since our last update. You can view and comment on the work in progress designs [here](https://beta.atomic.io/d/2oKCUOzyYEow). The new features include:

You can share a url to a particular view of Holodex. For example [stewardship](http://holodex.enspiral.com/groups/loomio?q%5B0%5D%5Blink%5D=%2FlinkTypes%2Fhas-member&q%5B0%5D%5Bsrc%5D=%2Fgroups%2Floomio&q%5B1%5D%5Blink%5D=%2FlinkTypes%2Fis-subgroup-of&q%5B1%5D%5Bsrc%5D=%2Fgroups%2Floomio&q%5B2%5D%5Blink%5D=%2FlinkTypes%2Fstewards&q%5B2%5D%5Bctx%5D=%2Fgroups%2Floomio&q%5B2%5D%5BshowLink%5D=true) in Loomio.

You can 'zoom and pan' using the mousewheel and 'grabbing' the chart. Behold! [Enormous Mikey](http://holodex.enspiral.com/people/mikey?v%5B0%5D=-3308&v%5B1%5D=-1851&v%5B2%5D=5.880006065834972)!

Context relationships (like stewardship) now have a 'toggle widget' for toggling the links. We're still [exploring the designs](https://beta.atomic.io/d/2oKCUOzyYEow) for this.

By popular demand, you can now view more details about an agent by hovering over it with the cursor. A tooltip will pop up with a larger avatar image and the name. In the future this may have more details (location, interests etc).

### Strategy

In no particular order, we want to:

1. Learn more about the market.
2. Get opensource contributors.
3. Consolidate our visualisation [value proposition](https://github.com/open-app/holodex/blob/master/comms/value-propositions.md). 

To achieve these we are:

1. Bringing on another user network (a herb exchange network in rural Wisconsin!) [1].
2. Making the codebase and tech stack legit and leveraging Mikey's role as the facilitator of Nodeschool Wellington [2].
3. Developing an MVP. We're close, we just need an easy way to add data and a Wordpress plugin [2].
3. Improvements within the current design: mobile responsive, improve page load time, improve search, more details about people and groups, more data, tags etc [3].
