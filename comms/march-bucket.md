This bucket is a continuation of our February bucket. We've received $1,110.37 of $2,000 and are seeking $889.63 more for Holodex 0.2. We really appreciate all the love and support. ♡

## Our progress since last month

Such month! ⌒(o＾▽＾o)ノ

Over the last month, we've
- purchased [holodex.is](http://holodex.is) and moved our Enspiral deployment to [holodex.enspiral.info](http://holodex.enspiral.info).
- setup a [top-level GitHub repo with our roadmap for user features](https://github.com/open-app/holodex/issues)
- setup a #holodex Slack channel
- implemented a few features
  - group page includes button controls to toggle showing types of relationships
  - clicking on a person within a group page navigates to person page
  - person page shows list of relationships for that person
- [iterated on our designs](https://github.com/open-app/holodex/issues/16#issuecomment-85870813) with the help of Nanz
- [iterated on our code](https://github.com/holodex/app/pulse/monthly) with the help of Simon, Mikey, Mix, and Joshua
- [iterated on our domain models](https://github.com/openvocab/holodex/issues) with the help of Bob and Lynn of [Mikorizal](http://mikorizal.org/), Simon, Mikey, Mix, and Joshua

## Our plan for this month

This month we plan to continue iterating towards our [0.2 release](https://github.com/open-app/holodex/milestones/0.2%20-%20Read-Only%20Multi-Group%20Madness). This release is intended to provide a read-only interface to navigate the people and groups within Enspiral Services, by visualizing an initial set of information on roles, relationships, and personal profiles. We're hoping this is the minimal feature set for Holodex to be usable as an app by more people in Enspiral.

As Simon and Mikey don't need the money from this bucket, we will use any money we receive to resource more help from others, particularly from Nanz, Mix, and any other interested collaborators.

## Our ask to the network

More important than funding, we're really keen to hear more from the network about what they find exciting about Holodex, how they see such a system improving their experience within the network, and what specific use cases would they like to see in an upcoming release. Please share how you feel on our [Dream User Experience document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fSWZsjm7qHOwkDoF19olutmUsm65m3_AVoveior-2Hw/edit#), in our #holodex channel on Slack, or contact Mikey at mikey@enspiral.com or in-person at Enspiral Space.
