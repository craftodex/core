## Holodex


Target: $2000
Scale to fit.

Please fund Holodex and get us to MVP! For the past 8 months Mikey and I have been developing Holodex part time between other commitments and contracts. Holodex is a service for integrating groupware apps and gives groups simple, beautiful, up to date visualisations of their network. Its for group admins and people in networked organisations like Enspiral. We're close to a MVP. Fund this bucket and help get us there
