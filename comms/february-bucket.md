Keeping track of all the teams, projects and relationships in a non-hierarchical org is hard! To solve this problem, Simon and Mikey have been working on ‘Holodex’ (Holons + Rolodex): an app for finding people’s info and keeping track of relationships with others in the network. We have a barebones MVP up at <http://craftodex2.enspiral.info> that visualizes stewardship relationships within Craftworks. This bucket will help us resource better designs, implement basic profiles and expand the data to include all teams and memberships within Enspiral Services. The app will be part of the Open App Ecosystem and we would like it to eventually be integrated with Cobudget and Loomio.
