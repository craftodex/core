# user interviews

[related issue](https://github.com/open-app/holodex/issues/56)

## what do we want to learn

- specific instances in which users faced a particularly difficult case or when something worked particularly well
  - TODO trying to find people
- which possible direction is most valued
  - TODO improve search
  - TODO user updates data in app
  - TODO pull data from source like Loomio
  - TODO admin updates data in spreadsheet
- moonshots
  - "If there were no constraints on this project – time, money, or anything else – how would you like Holodex to work and what would you like to see in it?"
- post-interview lingers
  - "Have you got anything you’d like to add or emphasize? Is there anything I missed?"
