## What problems does Holodex aim to solve?

###Communication and understanding

Its hard to communicate an organisation like Enspiral. Newcomers to fluid, networked organisations find orientation difficult and audiences misunderstand the network as a mysterious 'black box'. Attempts to the map the organsation quickly go out of date when the network reinvents itself every 6 months.

Holodex gives these oganisations beautiful configurable visualisations both for sharing with external audiences and helping insiders understand their 21st Century workplace. Visualisations seamlessly update as the  organisation grows and changes. 

###Discovery and search

Holodex makes it easy to find information on people and groups in your network while giving individuals fine-grained privacy control over their own data. 

Holodex takes advantage modern web technologies to provide powerful search and browsing experiences scoped to focus on people, relationships and groups.

Initially we will support a people search for use within specific networks. In later releases we will explore linking Holodex together and with existing global public databases like [dbpedia](http://wiki.dbpedia.org/) (contains information on 50 million public figures). Research questions that might take want a full day to answer [could be answered in seconds](https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikidata-l/2015-April/005852.html)


###Data maintenance and administration

solve the admin burden of maintaining group lists across platforms (b) solve the fatigue associated wth keeping user data consistent across platforms (c) reduce the development costs of creating software for groups (d) eliminate the cost of onboarding a network to the new platform
