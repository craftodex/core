## What problems does Holodex aim to solve?


##Communication and understanding

Its hard to communicate an organisation like Enspiral. Newcomers to fluid, networked organisations can find orientation difficult while audiences misunderstand the network as a mysterious 'black box'. Attempts to the map the organsation quickly go out of date when the network reinvents itself every 6 months.

Holodex gives these oganisations beautiful, configurable visualisations for sharing with external audiences and helping insiders understand their 21st Century workplace. Visualisations seamlessly update as the  organisation grows and changes. 

##Discovery and search

Holodex provides a directory of people and groups in your network while giving individuals fine-grained privacy control over their own data. 

Initially we will support people search for use within specific networks. In later releases we will explore linking your Holodex installation with other installatins and existing global public databases like [dbpedia](http://wiki.dbpedia.org/) (contains information on 50 million public figures). Research questions that might take want a full day to answer [could be answered in seconds](https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikidata-l/2015-April/005852.html)


##Data maintenance and administration

Holodex conslidates group and user account in one place with a flexible API and data integrations for the major platforms.  This solves the admin burden of maintaining group membership lists across platforms and the user fatigue associated wth keeping multiple accounts consistent. 

##App development

Because we're focused on people and groups our API supports all kinds of edge-cases. Groups with more than one parent group? Deeply nested child groups? Adhoc groups created on the fly? Developers can focus solving your users' problems rather than writing boilerplate groupware code. Using the Holodex API as the data source reduces development costs and eliminates the hassle of onboarding a network to the new platform.
