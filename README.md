# Holodex

## What Is Holodex?

Holodex is a directory web app to search, visualize, and organize your human networks. 

We want to be a modular app within the [Open App Ecosystem](https://github.com/open-app/core), where other apps can rely on us as the single source of truth for people and groups' profile, role, and relationship information. We are not a 'secure identity vault' that provides authentication (who you are), that is for another app.

This repo is the top-level repo for the project. You can find the app code repo [here](https://github.com/holodex/app).

### Features

- look into and across your human networks to find people
- understand who's wearing what hats in your group
- shape, size, and shift the structure of your organization
- manage responsibilities and accountabilities within your company
- track relationships amongst you and your peers
- dynamically burn and re-build your teams on demand
