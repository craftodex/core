# Contributor License Agreement

Holodex has a Contributor License Agreement, with the intended purpose of allowing Holodex to update to newer copyleft or copyfarleft licenses as it makes sense to do so. This is not a perfect solution to achieve this purpose, so if anyone has any better ideas [we appreciate suggestions](https://github.com/open-app/holodex/issues).

## How To Sign

To sign the Contributor License Agreement, first figure out if you are an individual or legal entity who is making a contribution.

Then read what you are signing

- [for individuals](./CLA-FOR-INDIVIDUALS)
- [for legal entities](./CLA-FOR-ENTITIES)
    
Next submit your electronic signature:

1. clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/open-app/holodex && cd holodex`)
1. add your contributor details to the `contributors` field in our [`package.json`](./package.json)
1. stage these new changes (`git add package.json`)
1. write a commit with a message of 'I, <name>, agree to the Holodex Contributor License Agreement.' (`git commit -m "I, ..."`)
1. [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) with your commit 

Yay, thanks for becoming a Contributor! :)
