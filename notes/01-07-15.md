@simontegg's process improvement: if you're struggling with an issue, don't do it. i value clarity over productivity, it's better for both for us to be doing things that we're motiivated to do and good at, there should be options to go into other areas to go in and learn about them. early on, signal your block, it's fine to go do something else, it's better for us to feel good about what we're doing. a problem that can emerge is issues have dependencies and when things are blocked it can hold up the entire system.

what goes with that is asking for support on issues you need help on.

possible to focus on two most attractive product angles:
- group data visualization
- canonical source of group data

plan to make concept diagrams from these angles.

more user interviews good, but not essential. @ahdinosaur will try to talk to Rich, Derek, and Chloe this week.

@simontegg will try and talk to Ants and Damien to get a clearer picture of what a proper MVP would look like. when LifeHack gets back next week he will try and talk with them.
