## Standup

### What you've done

@ahdinosaur:
- met with @nanz regarding the landing page design, she's keen to be creative director for a set of university design interns.
- improve landing page with awesome tech, didn't even take much work
- minor updates to comms and stuff

@simontegg:
- wrote some things about what we're trying to do
- writing an update about what we've done, what we're doing, and what we need help with

### What we're doing

@simontegg:
- continue on comms upates
- then get to translation between relationship data structure and visualization of relationships
  - useful to feed user discovery into this
- maybe get to route stuff

@ahdinosaur:
- work on landing page not with code but with designers
- finish the thing about holons and why named Holodex
- figure out how to do user discovery and find users to talk with
- condense our current design into a product architecture

### Blocks

@simontegg - tension around presenting a new Enspiral venture while still doing value discovery.

@ahdinosaur - none
