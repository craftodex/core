## Checkins

## Standup

### done

@simontegg has been working on `query` branch.
@ahdinosaur has been working on `spreadsheet` and `migrate-yml-to-csv` branches.

### doing

@simontegg will continue with `query`, then design "see more information about an agent" and other small tasks.
@ahdinosaur will continue with spreadsheets, then start the "take out the trash" refactor.

### blocks

@ahdinosaur feels somewhat blocked on spreadsheets. after talking, feels like he can proceed and get spreadsheets deployed in production.
