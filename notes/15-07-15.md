### Documenting Simplicity Process

on @simontegg's mind,

making process of Simplicity Oriented Design and Kano explicit:

- figure out breadth of problems
- prioritize problems
- action on possible solutions
- merge solutions that minimally solve problems

think maybe we should write this up and put it in our process directory.

#### What Is Simplicity?

simplicity of:

- codebase, data model, architecture
- features
- user interface

e.g. for navigate between groups,
- simple in the user interface
- sophisticated as a feature
- we want to tie it to a simple architecture

### Work Streams

- be a high-quality app to attract external open source talent
  - @ahdinosaur meets people every week at [NodeSchool Wellington](https://github.com/nodeschool/wellington) who want to learn React and are looking for something to contribute to
- become useful to Enspiral
  - get Enspiral's data
  - on-board an Enspiral admin
  - post an update to the wider Enspiral's Loomio
  - integrate with the front page of enspiral.com
- build an API on path towards either,
    1. users being able to update data
    1. other apps being able to integrate
